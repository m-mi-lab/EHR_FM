# Direct Probability Inference Configuration
# Single forward pass evaluation for clinical prediction tasks

# Data and model paths
data_dir: ${oc.env:TOKENIZED_TEST_DIR}
model: ${oc.env:BEST_MODEL_PATH}

# Evaluation parameters
num_samples: 1000  # Number of samples (prediction points) to evaluate per task
batch_size: 512
# Tasks to evaluate
# Available: hosp_mortality, icu_mortality, hosp_readmission, icu_readmission, icu_los
tasks:
  - hosp_mortality
  - icu_mortality
  - hosp_readmission
  - icu_readmission
  - icu_los

# Notes:
# - Uses direct probability method (single forward pass)
# - Binary tasks: AUROC, AUPRC, Accuracy
# - Regression tasks: MAE, RMSE, Correlation
# - Seeds are set via command line (run_infer.sh uses 43-62 for 20 reps)
